# Price_Matching
This project matches the sellers and buyers in a networked microgrid system based on the proposed prices.

The matching is buyer-optimized, which means that the buyers proposed first and the sellers accept or refuse the proposals.
Another version seller-optimized was tried but did not perform better than the buyer-optimized version.
